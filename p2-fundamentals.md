## Exercises

### Basic Requirements

#### Numbers

1. Enter the following expressions into your console.

   ```js
   1 + 2
   3 * 5
   5 / 4 - 13
   5000 * 234
   1073 / 57 + 200
   ```

2. Why are the values produced by the following two expressions different? What
   are they?

   ```js
   3 + 2 * 4 - 1
   (3 + 2) * (4 - 1)
   ```

3. Calculate how old you are in minutes using the console.

4. What is the percentage of people in the class with brown hair? Use the
   console to find out.

5. Try the following expressions in the console:

   ```js
   6 % 2
   42 % 10
   5 % 2
   6 % 3
   7 % 4
   100 % 12
   ```

   What is the significance of the result? How does the `%` (modulus) operator
   work?

6. Try the following:

   ```js
   3 % 2
   4 % 2
   5 % 2
   6 % 2
   ```

   What do the results tell you about the first operand to the modulus operator?

#### Strings

1. Write a string that represents your full name.

2. Write a string that represents your favorite food.

3. Use the `+` operator to combine (known as *concatenation*) two or more
   strings, *e.g.*:

   ```js
   // Your first and last names
   "Josh" + " " + "Lehman"
   ```

   + Your first and last names (as shown above)
   + Your parents' full names
   + Your home town and state

4. Fix the errors in the following strings:

   ```js
   Where are all the quotes?
   'hmm something is not right"
   'Do other ' * 'operators work with string concatenation?
   ```
