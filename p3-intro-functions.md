# Introduction to Functions

**Before getting started, make sure that you're familiar with
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Make sure you download a new project for today's
lesson (explained in the previous link).**

## Exercises

### Basic Requirements

1. In the console on the blank `index.html` page, try the following and verify
   that the results match your expectations:

   ```js
   square(10) + 2;
   square(100) + square(77);
   square(8 / 2)
   square(2 + 17);
   square(square(15));
   ```

2. Write a sentence in plain English describing how `square(square(15))` is
   evaluated.

3. Rename the parameter to `square` in your `main.js` file to `monkey`, and
   rename the uses of that parameter in the body to `monkey` as well. Will the
   function `square` still work? Why or why not?

4. What is wrong with the following definitions of `square`? Write a sentence or
   two describing the issue(s); then, try copying the erroneous examples into a
   console one-at-a-time and observing the error(s) generated (you may have to
   attempt to invoke the functions to see the error). What errors are produced
   (if any) for each erroneous version? Do the errors make sense?

   ```js
   function square(monkey) {
     return x * x;
   }

   function square(5) {
     return 5 * 5;
   }

   function square("x") {
     return "x" * "x";
   }
   ```

5. Fix the invalid syntax in the following functions (you can copy and paste these
   invalid definitions into `main.js` and then edit them there):

   ```js
   func square1(x {
     return x * x;
   }

   functionsquare2 x)
     return x * x;
   }

   function (x) square3 {
     return x * x;
   ```

6. The following functions exhibit poor style -- fix these issues using the
   original version of `square` as a reference.

   ```js
   function square(x){return x*x;}

   function square (x) { return x *x;
   }

   function square(x)
   {
   return x * x;
   }
   ```

7. Complete the function `cube` that returns the cube of x:

  ```js
  function cube(x) {
    // your code here
  }
  ```

8. Complete the function `fullName` that should take two parameters, `firstName`
   and `lastName`, and returns the `firstName` and `lastName` concatenated
   together with a space in between.

  ```js
  // don't forget the parameters!
  function fullName() {
    // your code here
  }
  fullName("John", "Doe") // => "John Doe"
  ```

9. Write a function `average` that takes two numbers as input (parameters), and
   returns the average of those numbers.

10. Write a function `greeter` that takes a name as an argument and *greets*
    that name by returning something along the lines of `"Hello, <name>!"`

11. Using the document found at <a href="http://www.gbcnv.edu/documents/ASC/docs/00000005.pdf" target="_blank">this link</a>, translate the first page of geometric
    formulas into JavaScript functions.

    As an example, a function to compute the perimeter of a rectangle might look
    like this:

    ```js
    function perimeterRect(l, w) {
      return 2 * (l + w);
    }
    ```

    **NOTE:** JavaScript provides some nifty mathematical functions and
    constants built into the language that you'll need for this exercise. The
    two that we'll be making use of are:

    ```js
    Math.PI; // => 3.141592653589793
    Math.sqrt(256); // => 16
    ```

    To test your answers, you'll need to:

    1. Save the JavaScript file that you enter your code into,
    2. Reload the corresponding `index.html` file (the one in the same directory as
       the `main.js` file that your code is in),
    3. Call the function with arguments in the console to see the result, e.g.
      `perimeterRect(2, 6)`.
    4. Eventually, you may want to verify that the output is correct. Google is a
       great tool for this:

### More Practice

Translate the rest of the geometric formulas found <a href="http://www.gbcnv.edu/documents/ASC/docs/00000005.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> into JavaScript functions.

### Advanced

1. Compound interest can be calculated with the formula:

    ![future value](img/future-value.png)

    - *F*: future value
    - *P*: present value
    - *i*: nominal interest rate
    - *n*: compounding frequency
    - *t*: time

  Write a function `futureValue` that can be used to calculate the *future value*
  of a quantity of money using compound interest.

  Use the function to calculate what the future value of $1700 (*P* = 1700)
  deposited in a bank that pays an annual interest rate of 4.7% (*i* = 0.047),
  compounded quarterly (*n* = 4) after 6 years (*t* = 6) (you can use `Math.pow`
  to do exponentiation).

2. Write a `power` function that accepts the parameters `base` and `exponent`
   and returns the result. Replace `square` and `cube` with the `power` function
   you just wrote. Do not use `Math.pow`.

3. Write your own square-root function called `sqrt` that accepts a `number`
   parameter and returns an approximate square root. Square-root approximations
   make use of averages. Be sure to use the `average` function you previously
   wrote. The first version of your square root function should perform no more
   than 3 successive averages.
